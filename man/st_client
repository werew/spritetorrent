.Sh DESCRIPTION

.Nm

.Ar st_tracker 
running on the same or a separate machine in order to work correclty.

.It Fl h
Shows the help
.It Fl l Ar localaddr 
Add localaddr to the addresses to declare when sharing a file.
.It Fl t Ar tracker port
Add the given tracker (address + port)  to the list of trackers
availables. 
.It Fl g Ar filehash dest
Get a file: download the file identified by the given filehash
and write it into dest. When getting a file an st_client will first
need to lookup the other client sharing the given file for this it
will need to query one or more trackers thus at least one tracker
must be defined when using this option.
.It Fl p Ar file
Put a file: share the given file. When putting a file an st_client
will compute the hash of the file and push it to all the known
trackers and for all the local address declared. Thus when using
the option -p, both options -t and -l must be set at least once 
otherwise the option -p will not have any effect.
.El                      \" Ends the list

.Sh EXAMPLES 
Download the file identified by the given hash and write it to
the file "output". Do this by quering the only tracker known:
127.0.0.1 5555 and using the post 2222:
.Pp
st_client \-t 127.0.0.1 5555 \-g 1d0a45d76618201268141f3b4e3d8f08907da99c42906c55466c04a39dabd908 output 2222
.Pp
Share the file "myfile" by pushing the hash into the tracker
198.164.1.32 5555 and declaring the local address 132.1.0.34 which
will be used to the other client to contact us:
.Pp
st_client \-t 198.164.1.32 5555 -l 132.1.0.34 \-p myfile 2222
